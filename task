The goal of this test is to demonstrate your programming capabilities in python.
Use an arbitrage algorithm to find the arbitrage paths for the provided data set. 
I've included an example to the Bellman-Ford algorithm below, but you're welcome to find a better one. Just don't use the brute force method in this example. 
There may be many arbitragable paths, but the goal is to find at least one 2-leg trade and at least one 3-leg trade.
You can assume we have all necessary assets on all exchanges. 

Please let me know if you have any questions along the way. You can email me at jz@keeperdao.com. 

1.) Install python3 (the latest 3.x version should be fine, just not python 2.x)
2.) Take a look at the Bellman-Ford algorithm, https://gist.github.com/anilpai/fe4e11b5c59d8c02813900813396400b
    This one should copy/paste just fine without needing to install much of anything. 
    You're welcome to find a better algorithm or another implementation of the same algorithm. 
    Just don't use the brute force method.
3.) Take the provided market prices data set and create a graph that can be inputted into your algorithm.  
    Note: when inputing data into the graph, I don't think Bellman-Ford directly supports multiple exchanges.
          So to use the data below (which contains multiple exchanges) you can use the best possible price across all exchanges
          Example: Parse the data dictionary below and find the best bid price across all ETH-USDC markets.  And use only that exchange's price.  
                   Do the same thing for both bids and asks, for all market pairs.  
                   So the graph will contain only the best prices, not the 2nd or 3rd best prices. 
4.) Find profitable paths (at least one 2-leg trade and one 3-leg trade), print them out.  You can completely disregard trading fees, just assume they are built into the price.  
5.) Quantify profitability.  Sort the found profitable paths from most profitable to least profitable.  

Two known profitable paths to look for are:
  - rep -> eth -> usdc -> rep
      - REP -> ETH at Coinbase (selling REP at bid price)
      - ETH -> USDC at Facebook Marketplace (selling ETH at bid price)
      - USDC -> REP at Sketchy dude at the bar (buying REP at ask price)
  - rep -> eth -> rep
      - REP -> ETH at Coinbase (selling REP at bid price)
      - ETH -> REP at Creepy White Van (buying REP at ask price)
